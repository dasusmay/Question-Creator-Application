Question,Answer
1. What is correlation in statistics?,"According to the provided context, correlation is a statistical measure that expresses the extent to which two variables are linearly related. It is a common tool for describing simpler relationships without making a statement about cause and effect. Correlation coefficients range from -1 to 1, with a value of 0 indicating no linear relationship between the two variables, a value of 1 indicating a perfect positive linear relationship, and a value of -1 indicating a perfect negative linear relationship."
2. What is the range of correlation coefficients?,"According to the provided context, the range of correlation coefficients is from -1 to 1."
3. What does a correlation coefficient of 0 indicate?,"According to the provided context, a correlation coefficient of 0 indicates a nonlinear relationship between the two variables."
4. What is one of the uses of correlation in statistics?,"One of the uses of correlation in statistics is to identify relationships between variables. Correlation can be used to determine whether there is a relationship between two variables, and if so, whether the relationship is positive or negative. This information can be useful for understanding the relationships between different factors in a complex system."
5. In which field is correlation used to identify relationships between different business variables?,"According to the provided context, correlation is used in the field of Business to identify relationships between different business variables, such as sales, advertising spending, and customer satisfaction."
